You can also contact us if you still cannot find your package."

        question: "When can I expect to receive my books once after I have placed an order?",
        answer: "If the book is in stock in our stores or our partner stores you should get the book within 2 – 4 working days. If the book is not in stock it will put “on order” where we order it from a publisher or supplier. This should take 1 -2 weeks. Overseas books which are not available anywhere in the country could take longer than 3 weeks to bring in. In such cases we will try to offer you an e-book or find an alternative."
