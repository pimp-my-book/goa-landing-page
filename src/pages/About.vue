          AskThuto helps bursaries to manage their book allowances by removing wastage and ensuring that students get the materials they need on time. AskThuto is tech driven as it uses an online portal to ensure that students only order books which are prescribed for their courses. Students place their orders online and are able to track and follow their orders. Students do not have to wait in long lines at bookstores as the books are delivered directly to their accommodation. Bursaries are able to log in at any time and see a summary of their studentâ€™s orders and their expenditure. This is the smartest way of managing book allowances.
