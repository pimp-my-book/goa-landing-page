    p2: 'We came across many students visiting our stores requesting quotations for their bursaries or asking us to reserve a book while they wait for payment. We realized that this was very inefficient and it was inconveniencing the students. It became clear to us that it was not enoughto help students, but we also had to help those who help students.',
    p3: 'We created a solution that makes it easy for bursary students to order textbooks while giving the bursary control over their allowances. In 2017 we landed our first big client, today we serve students in all major cities in South Africa. In 2018 we developed a digital platform thatmanages the order process, gives control and provides bursaries with insightful expenditure reports.',
    p4: 'In 2019 we spun off the division as a separate entity called GOA. GOA is a digital platform that helps bursaries to manage their book allowances. GOA checks that the book is prescribed for the particular course. GOA sources the book from publishers or third party vendors and delivers it to the student. GOA has helped our clients remove wasteful expenditure saving them 30% on their overall allowance budget. This was achieved while still ensuring that students got all the materials that they need to succeed.'
